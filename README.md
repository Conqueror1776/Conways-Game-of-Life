# Overview
This rendition of Conway's game of life was created using the 'curses' library in Python, allowing for the simulation to be run directly in the terminal. The world is a finite wrap around world, which changes based on the size of the running terminal. In order for curses to function properly the terminal should not be resized while the simulation is running.
